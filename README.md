# 📊 Customer Analytics Project (Python + Power BI)

## 🔹 Overview
This project focuses on **Customer Analytics** using customer feedback data.  
The main goal is to analyze **commendations and complaints** to identify service quality trends, highlight recurring issues, and provide actionable insights.  

We use:
- **Python** for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting.

## 🔹 Problem Statement
Organizations receive large volumes of customer feedback in the form of commendations and complaints.  
However, this data is often unstructured and underutilized.  

This project transforms raw data into **business intelligence dashboards** that help:  
- Track **complaints vs commendations** over time.  
- Identify **frequent issues** raised by customers.  
- Compare **performance across routes and employee roles**.
